# 6-parameters-carbon-dots-nanosensor
The study presents a novel approach to the development of a photoluminescent multimodal carbon dots-based nanosensor for determining the concentration of $Cu^{2+}$, $Ni^{2+}$, $Pb^{2+}$, $Co^{2+}$, $Al^{3+}$, $Cr^{3+}$ and $NO_3^-$ ions in water using machine learning methods.
